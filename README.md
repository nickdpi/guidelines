# Our Community Guidelines

Hello! This is a template for our community guidelines, replete with source code comments. Style it however you’d like, and adapt it to your needs. They apply to any events that our household happens to throw, and should be useful for people who do lots of entertaining and have lots of people coming through their space.

We’ve cut out a few parts of the guidelines that are specific to our community, and hope that you fill in the parts that work for you.

These guidelines use [Bigfoot](http://www.bigfootjs.com), an inline footnoting system. You’ll want to download Bigfoot, unzip it to your source folder, and use that.
